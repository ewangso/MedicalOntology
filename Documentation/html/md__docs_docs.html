Overview</h1>
<p>In medical research, an ontology is defined as the structural representation of medical terminologies and the relationships between them. This project is a 3-D representation of an actual Medical Ontology. For this particular visualization style, the terminologies of the ontology are represented by nodes placed in a tree-like structure. Each node represents a medical terminology, and the edges represent the relationship between them. This project is meant to be used in a Virtual Reality environment. Most of the scripts are written in C#.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
Nodes</h1>
<p>All the data for the nodes come from the CVDO.csv file containing information about a node's parent, children, description and more. Parent and children nodes are related to each other. Child nodes can be considered as subtype terminologies of a parent node. Each node also has an ID, preferred label, and definition. An ID is how each node is idenfitied. The label is how the node will be named in the Unity UI. Although a proper labelling standard has not been determined for this particular project yet, there will be one in the future. Lastly, the definition of a node is the definition of the node's medical terminology.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
MedicalPlotter</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="class_medical_plotter.html">MedicalPlotter</a> is the main script used to initialize and sort the nodes. All data from the CSV file is parsed by this script and then placed in the Unity3D scene as GameObjects. The nodes are formed in a cylindrical shape. Nodes who have the same y-coordinate make up a layer. The layers of nodes are assigned based off of how many children and parents they have. All leaf nodes are nodes that have no children. They are assigned layer 0 and therefore, are placed at the bottom row of the structure. The root node is placed at the top layer. In order to sort the nodes correctly, all the nodes within each layer are placed adjacent to each other if they are siblings. This means that they have the same parent. Their parent node is then placed one layer above the nodes directly on top of its children.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Collide</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="class_collide.html">Collide</a> is a script attached to each node. It helps to make sure that nodes do not overlap and overcrowd each other. Before nodes are placed in a circle formation, the nodes are placed in a line to ensure that nodes within the circle do not overcrowd each other. The estimated amount of time it takes for all nodes to separate from each other is about 60 seconds. After 60 seconds, the nodes are then re-sorted into a cylinder shape. This is done through coroutines in Unity, which allow for functions to be called after a certain amount of time.<br  />
 Additionally, this script sets the position of a parent node to its middle child's position once per frame. This ensures that the parent is always in close proximity to its children. This makes it easier, since <a class="el" href="class_medical_plotter.html">MedicalPlotter</a> only has to sort the very bottom layer of nodes and the above layers will sort themselves. <br  />
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
ChangeVisibility</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="class_change_visibility.html">ChangeVisibility</a> script allows the user to enable and disable nodes for easier viewing. The <a class="el" href="class_change_visibility.html">ChangeVisibility</a> script powers the Expand and Collapse Children buttons on the a node's menu object. Every node has a menu object that allows the user to perform different functionalities. Collapse Children minimizes the node's children nodes, making them invisible to the user. Expand Children maximizes the node's children, making them visible to the user. The purpose of this script is to allow the user to simplify the graphical structure of the ontology to their liking. </p>
